# Computational Astrophysics

This repository contains codes written for the Computational Astrophysics course as part of the Masters in Theoretical Physics
from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid.

The course contents included:
    
   1.- Concepts of High-Performance Computing.
   
   2.- Numerical Methods (Numerical Integration and Solving Differential Equations).
   
   3.- Summary of the relevant physical processes (Boltzmann equation for N-body systems, Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics).
   
   4.- Solving for Gravity (direct summation, Eulerian methods including PM and AMR, Lagrangian methods: tree, multipole expansion, Hybrid methods: treePM).
   
   5.- Dynamics of Gases (Eulerian methods: AMR, Lagrangian methods: SPH)
   
   
The file `kepler.c` includes a simulation of the Solar System (all of the planets and the Moon) using the leapfrog algorithm.

The file `leapfrog.c` includes a simulation of the Sun-Earth orbit using the leapfrog algorithm.

The file `mandelbrot.c` includes the generation of a Mandelbrot series.

The file `rk4.c` includes a simulation of the Sun-Earth orbit using a 4th order Runge-Kutta integration scheme.
